Pix2Tec

Our project is an Azure-web-hosted application that processes and examines images of mathematical expressions -- typically through the medium of well-formatted image captures of handwriting -- by virtue of a robustly trained convolutional neural network developed with the help of a combination of APIs from OpenCV and Microsoft Azure's COmputer Vision. The URL of the application, which is live, is http://pics2tex.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com.
